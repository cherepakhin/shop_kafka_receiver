  clean-indexes                                                       Delete untruncated Kafka log indexes from the filesystem.
  cluster-restart help                                                Determine the server restart sequence for kafka
  controller                                                          Print the current controller.
  drain <broker id> [--topic <t>] [--brokers <ids>]                   Reassign partitions from a specific broker to destination brokers.
  elect-leaders [topic]                                               Begin election of the preferred leaders.
  partitions [topic]                                                  Print partitions by topic.
  partitions [topic] --under-replicated                               Print partitions by topic (only under-replicated).
  partitions [topic] --unavailable                                    Print partitions by topic (only unavailable).
  reassign [topics] [--brokers <ids>] [--replicas <n>]                Begin reassignment of partitions.
  resign-rewrite <broker id>                                          Forcibly rewrite leaderships to exclude a broker.
  resign-rewrite <broker id> --force                                  Same as above but proceed if there are no available ISRs.
  set-replication-factor [topic] [--newrf <n>] [--brokers id[,id]]    Set the replication factor of
  shutdown <broker id>                                                Gracefully remove leaderships from a broker (requires JMX).
  topics                                                              Print all topics.
  verify-replicas  [--topics] [--broker <id>] [--print-details] [--print-summary]Check if all partitions in a topic have same number of replicas.
